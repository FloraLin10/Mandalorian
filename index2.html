      <h2>My Top 10 Favorite Mandalorian Characters</h2>
      <p>
        The Mandalorian series has introduced us to so many amazing and unforgettable characters. Here's my list of favorites.

    <section id="character-10">
        <h2>10. Kuiil</h2>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Kuiil.gif" alt="Kuiil GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Kuiil is one of those characters that just stands out. He’s tough, wise, and has that no-nonsense attitude with his famous line, 'I have spoken.' But what really makes him special is how much heart he has. He was always there to help, whether it was guiding Mando or looking out for Grogu. His death hit hard. It felt like losing a mentor, someone who truly cared and always tried to do the right thing. Kuiil may have been quiet and reserved, but he left a lasting impact on me."

      <section id="character-9">
        <h3>9. Jawa</h3>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Jawa.gif" alt="Jawa GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "The Jawas are a hilarious part of The Mandalorian. At first, they’re so frustrating, stealing Mando’s stuff and causing all kinds of trouble. But then, they turn around and try to resell his own gear back to him, which is just too funny. What really cracks me up, though, is how these little scavengers seem to find absolutely anything. No matter what it is, they’ve got it all, and they know how to make a deal out of it. Their antics never get old and always bring a smile to my face."

      <section id="character-8">
        <h4>8. R5-D4</h4>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/R5-D4.gif" alt="R5-D4 GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "R5-D4 is just pure vibe. The way Peli tries to sell him as the perfect, brave droid for the mission is hilarious, especially when R5 is right there, visibly scared and trying to get out of it. It’s clear he’s not too thrilled about the whole thing. Sure, he’s a bit of a scaredy-cat like many droids, but when it’s really needed, he does come through. Honestly, his terrified reactions had me laughing, but I’ve got to give him credit for stepping up when Mando needed him."

      <section id="character-7">
        <h5>7. Boba Fett</h5>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Boba_Fett.gif" alt="Boba Fett GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Boba Fett is something else. He’s an incredibly skilled fighter with moves that no one else can match. I actually watched The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett before the original Star Wars movies, so seeing how Boba Fett ended up in the situation shown at the start of The Book of Boba Fett was such a rewarding moment. But I’ve got to say, when that scene actually played out and Boba Fett got pushed into the sand creature by a temporarily blind guy, I couldn’t stop laughing. I thought Boba was about to do something legendary, but nope, it was just a total accident!"

      <section id="character-6">
        <h6>6. Cobb Vanth (The Marshal)</h6>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Cobb_Vanth.gif" alt="Cobb Vanth (The Marshal) GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Cobb Vanth, or 'The Marshal,' is one interesting character. When I first saw him, part of me kept waiting for him to turn bad, like so many other characters before him. But, to my relief, he turned out to be a good guy, and I really grew to like him (that was all in one episode, literally). He’s got this rugged, yet honorable vibe that makes him stand out. He’s the kind of person who will do anything in his power to protect his town and the people he cares about, which makes him a true hero. Unfortunately, his death at the end of The Book of Boba Fett was pretty heavy… or was it really his death?"

      <section id="character-5">
        <div class="character-heading">5. IG-11</div>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/IG-11.gif" alt="IG-11 GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "IG-11 is a special one for me. He starts off as a droid on a mission to kill Grogu, but things quickly take a turn. Mando ends up having to kill him, but then Kuiil finds him and fixes him up, turning him into a protector. When we meet him again, he’s literally serving tea to Mando, and from then on, he’s all about protecting Grogu. His sacrifice to save Grogu, Mando, and the gang was one of the saddest moments for me—Mando even seemed emotional about it. But the journey doesn’t end there. When Mando tries to get him repaired, IG-11 returns to his original function: to kill Grogu. That doesn’t last long, though, and later we meet IG-12, which is basically made for Grogu to control. That scene cracked me up! Honestly, IG-11/12 has probably been through the most in this show."

      <section id="character-4">
        <div class="character-heading">4. Bo-Katan Kryza</div>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Bo-Katan_Kryze.gif" alt="Bo-Katan Kryza GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Bo-Katan Kryze is just incredible. She’s strong, independent, and has this vibe that makes her impossible not to admire. I love how she doesn’t back down, even when the odds are against her. One of the most memorable moments for me was when she sees the Mythosaur in real life. Suddenly, it wasn’t just a myth anymore; she saw it with her own eyes. Her views really shifted in that moment. After she bathed in the living waters and joined Mando’s group, she had to learn that lifestyle, including not taking off their masks in front of living things. I laughed when she asked Mando, ‘How do we eat with our masks on?’ and Mando replied, ‘We don’t. We just go find a separate place alone.’ I was like, yes, that’s exactly what I’ve been wondering! She’s like a baby learning the steps to Mando’s rules, or technically, the ancestors' rules. She’s tough as nails, but you can see the weight of her past in her eyes. She's just one of those characters who brings both power and heart to the table."

      <section id="character-3">
        <div class="character-heading">3. Peli Motto</div>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Peli_Motto.GIF" alt="Peli Motto GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Peli Motto is just the best. She’s got this charm and cleverness that makes her stand out. I loved that one scene where she tricked a customer into thinking she hadn’t finished her job so she could get more money. She really knew how to work the system—taking apart what she finished and pretending she needed more time was pure genius. Plus, that new ship she made for Mando? Absolutely epic. Peli knows how to get things done. I just love her energy and resourcefulness."

      <section id="character-2">
        <div class="character-heading">2. Din Djarin (Mando)</div>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Mando_Din.GIF" alt="Din Djarin (Mando) GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Mando is just the best, hands down. His skills are unbeatable, and no one else quite compares to him. He’s this incredible mix of toughness, heart, and raw talent. It’s impossible not to fall in love with him. And his relationship with Grogu? Ugh, it’s the cutest thing ever. The bond they share is pure magic, and I can watch their dynamic over and over again. Honestly, Mando and Grogu together have completely stolen my heart, and I could rewatch the show a million times just for them."
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="character-1">
        <div class="character-heading">1. Grogu</div>
        <div class="gif-container">
          <img src="images/Grogu.GIF" alt="Grogu GIF">
        </div>
        <p>
            "Grogu is the cutest little thing ever. Seriously, nothing is as cute as him—not even a baby could compare. I could easily watch 100 seasons just featuring Grogu. One of my favorite moments is when we see him training with Luke Skywalker in The Book of Boba Fett. Those few scenes? I could watch a billion times. And Grogu is such a kid at heart. His child-like antics are hilarious, especially when he acts like a little troublemaker. Of course, we can’t forget how much he loves food—he’s got an appetite! But with his powers, I’m pretty sure he could get whatever he wants, no problem."
